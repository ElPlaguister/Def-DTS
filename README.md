# Def-DTS
Official code for ACL 2025 paper: Def-DTS: Deductive Reasoning for Open-domain Dialogue Topic Segmentation.

## Overview
<!-- ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/files) -->

This is the overview of Def-DTS framework.

- We introduce LLM reasoning techniques to DTS for the first time, consolidating insights from previous methodologies into a coherent and deductive prompt design.

- We reformulate DTS as an utterance-level intent classification task by implementing intent classification as a core component of a multi-step reasoning process, enabling flexible and task-agnostic prompting.

- Our method empirically demonstrates superior performance across nearly all comparative baselines, underscoring the efficacy of prompt engineering in DTS.

- Through an in-depth analysis of our approach's reasoning results, we shed light on the challenges LLM reasoning faces in DTS and discuss the possibility of using LLM as a DTS auto-labeler.
